# number guessing-game

In number guessing game we used if else statements and while loop.

we used random function for system so it can take any random integer.

we take math function for calculate the log.

also we have takken log base 2 for enough chances for users.

->How it works?

When user give the lower and upper value to the system...

System takes random integers from given range 
and gives chance to the user according to the range.

now user enter the value between that range and system check that the given value maches or not.
if it is higher or lower than system pradict then it will shows,
And if user lose all chance to guess than system reveals the value.
